    <p>pfft over the lack of color on the crust (I had a word with my dinky oven about it). 
        I absolutely love this about cooking — the way we care so deeply about the way our food is made,
         and how much I’m lucky enough to learn about the different ways people approach the same dish.
        But, my other favorite part about cooking is that it’s just you in the kitchen and you can make your food the way you alone like it. 
        Feel free to tweak this to your taste by replacing portions of the beef with other meats, 
        using less tomato paste or wine if desired or replacing some wine with milk.</p>
